why is still use maven

- list the 'new age' build tools:
 - SBT, Gradle, etc..

Drawback of using maven
 - aged
 - XML-only
 - not as flexible as the other tools

Why I still use it
- constrain the number of variations in the build process
- familiarity as maven builds on common practices 
- there is a lot of tool support (IDEs unserstand pom.xml, can show transitive dependencies etc)
- Do I really need the full power of a programming language?
  - Problems that are 'fought' can be easily dealt by simplifying and streamlining the build
  - If you app needs a lot of customization to build, you are doing things wrong on your project, not on the tools!
